# Dilution of precision
Dilution of precision (DOP), or geometric dilution of precision (GDOP), is a term used in satellite navigation and geomatics engineering to specify the error propagation as a mathematical effect of navigation satellite geometry on positional measurement precision.

When both horizontal and vertical components are combined, the uncertainty of three-dimensional positions is called position dilution of precision (PDOP). There is also time dilution of precision (TDOP), which indicates the uncertainty of the clock

! Description
|-
| <1
| Ideal
| Highest possible confidence level to be used for applications demanding the highest possible precision at all times.
|-
| 1–2
| Excellent
| At this confidence level, positional measurements are considered accurate enough to meet all but the most sensitive applications.
|-
| 2–5
| Good
| Represents a level that marks the minimum appropriate for making accurate decisions. Positional measurements could be used to make reliable in-route navigation suggestions to the user.
|-
| 5–10
| Moderate
| Positional measurements could be used for calculations, but the fix quality could still be improved. A more open view of the sky is recommended.
|-
| 10–20
| Fair
| Represents a low confidence level. Positional measurements should be discarded or used only to indicate a very rough estimate of the current location.
|-
| >20
| Poor
| At this level, measurements should be discarded.
